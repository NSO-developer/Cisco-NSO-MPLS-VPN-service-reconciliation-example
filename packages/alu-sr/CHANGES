alu-sr v3.4 [June 11, 2015]
============================

Enhancements:
Corrections:
    - Make the NED calculate transid also when it is connected to a netsim
      device.

    - Changed most of the shutdown leafs in the YANG model.
      Most of them are now modeled as booleans with default values.

    - The NED is now using the new default value presentation feature
      that was introduced in NCS version 3.3.2

This NED does require NCS version 3.2.1.2 or later.


alu-sr v3.0.1 [March 20, 2014]
==============================

Corrections:

  - The previous released was based on software from the main NCS
    development branch. This was wrong. The alu-sr NED had been
    maintained on the NCS Confd-5.0 branch. This release  contains
    the accurate version as picked from the Confd-5.0 branch.


alu-sr v3.0 [March 11, 2014]
============================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.0.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

For this NED no upgrades are necessary.


===============================================================================
The Tail-f package: alu-sr NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
