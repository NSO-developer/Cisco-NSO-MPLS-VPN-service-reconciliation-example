========================================

Enhancements:
   -  The method to use by the NED for calculating transaction ID is now a
      configurable option.
      The config option cisco-iosxr-transaction-id-method is available under:

      /ncs:devices/global-settings/ned-settings/

      /ncs:/device/devices/device:<dev name>/ned-settings/

      Two values are supported:
      config-hash (default) : Use a snapshot of the running config for
                              calculation.
      commit-list :           Use the configuration commit list time of
                              the latest commit for calculation.

cisco-iosxr v3.0 [March 4, 2014]
================================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.7.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

Non-backwards compatible corrections:

  - This NED was formerly named "cisco-ios-xr". It has now been renamed to
    "cisco-iosxr" according to the new naming convention.
    When replacing older cisco-ios-xr NED with this version the old directory
    needs to be removed. Existing CDB data is not affected by this change.


===============================================================================
The Tail-f package: cisco-iosxr NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
