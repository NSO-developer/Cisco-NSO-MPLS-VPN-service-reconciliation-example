    (Issue tracker: #14658)


juniper-junos v3.0 [March 3, 2014]
==================================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 2.2.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

Non-backwards compatible corrections:

  - This NED was formerly named "junos". It has now been renamed to
    "juniper-junos" according to the new naming convention.
    When replacing older junos NED with this version the old directory
    needs to be removed. Existing CDB data is not affected by this change.


===============================================================================
The Tail-f package: juniper-junos NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
